I’ll help you create detailed requirements for a DAG implementation in Java with comprehensive error handling and reprocessing strategies.

# DAG Implementation Requirements - Error Handling & Reprocessing

## 1. Core Execution Model

**Requirement 1.1 - Task Dependency Management**
The system must maintain a directed acyclic graph where each task node contains metadata about its dependencies (parent tasks) and dependents (child tasks). Before executing any task, the system must verify all parent tasks have completed successfully. The system must detect cycles during DAG construction and reject invalid graphs.

**Requirement 1.2 - Parallel Execution**
When multiple tasks have satisfied dependencies, the system must execute them concurrently using a thread pool or executor service. The degree of parallelism should be configurable with a maximum concurrent task limit to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 2. Error Classification & Handling

**Requirement 2.1 - Error Types**
The system must distinguish between:

- Transient errors (network timeouts, temporary resource unavailability) that may succeed on retry
- Permanent errors (invalid input, logic errors, authorization failures) that will consistently fail
- System errors (out of memory, thread interruption) that may require full DAG termination
- Timeout errors when tasks exceed maximum execution duration

**Requirement 2.2 - Error Propagation Strategies**
The system must support configurable error propagation modes:

*Fail-Fast Mode:* When any task fails, immediately cancel all running tasks and prevent new task execution. The entire DAG execution terminates with failure status.

*Fail-Independent Mode:* When a task fails, only its dependent downstream tasks are marked as blocked and not executed. Other independent branches of the DAG continue executing. This maximizes partial work completion.

*Fail-Tolerant Mode:* Task failures are logged but don’t prevent downstream execution. Downstream tasks receive error indicators for failed parents and decide how to proceed (skip, use defaults, or fail).

## 3. Retry & Reprocessing Mechanisms

**Requirement 3.1 - Task-Level Retry Configuration**
Each task must support configurable retry policies including:

- Maximum retry attempts (0 means no retries)
- Retry delay strategy (fixed, exponential backoff, or custom)
- Backoff multiplier and maximum delay cap for exponential strategies
- Which error types are retryable versus non-retryable

**Requirement 3.2 - Retry Execution Behavior**
When a task fails and is eligible for retry, the system must wait for the specified delay period before re-executing the task in the same execution context. Failed attempts must be logged with attempt number, error details, and timestamp. If all retry attempts are exhausted, the task enters permanent failure state.

**Requirement 3.3 - DAG-Level Reprocessing**
The system must support reprocessing the entire DAG or partial subtrees after a failed execution. Reprocessing options include:

*Full Reprocess:* Re-execute all tasks from scratch, ignoring any previously completed work.

*Resume from Failure:* Only re-execute failed tasks and their downstream dependents, reusing results from successful tasks. This requires persistent state management.

*Selective Reprocess:* Allow specification of which tasks to re-execute, automatically determining affected downstream tasks.

## 4. Corner Cases & Edge Scenarios

**Requirement 4.1 - Concurrent Failures in Parallel Tasks**
When multiple parallel tasks fail simultaneously, the system must handle all failures atomically without race conditions. Error aggregation must collect all failure information before determining overall DAG status. If retry policies differ between tasks, each must retry independently without blocking others.

**Requirement 4.2 - Partial Dependency Failure**
When a task has multiple parent dependencies and only some fail, the behavior depends on configuration:

- ALL mode: Task executes only if all parents succeed
- ANY mode: Task executes if at least one parent succeeds
- MAJORITY mode: Task executes if more than 50% of parents succeed
  The system must clearly track which parent results are available versus missing.

**Requirement 4.3 - Retry Exhaustion During Parallel Execution**
If Task A and Task B are executing in parallel, both retrying, and Task A exhausts retries while Task B is still attempting, the system must allow Task B to complete its retry attempts before making final DAG-level decisions, unless fail-fast mode is enabled.

**Requirement 4.4 - Task Timeout with Retry**
When a task times out, the system must interrupt the task thread and treat timeout as a retryable error. If the task is retried and times out again, each timeout attempt counts against the retry limit. The system must prevent zombie tasks by ensuring interrupted threads are properly cleaned up.

**Requirement 4.5 - Resource Cleanup on Failure**
When tasks fail, the system must invoke cleanup handlers to release resources (file handles, database connections, locks). Cleanup must occur even if the task is being retried, and cleanup failures must not prevent retry attempts but should be logged.

**Requirement 4.6 - Circular Dependency Detection**
Although DAGs are acyclic by definition, the system must detect and reject circular dependencies during graph construction. If dynamic dependencies are added at runtime, the system must validate acyclicity before allowing the addition.

**Requirement 4.7 - Empty DAG or Disconnected Components**
The system must handle DAGs with no tasks or with disconnected subgraphs. For disconnected components, all components should execute independently. An empty DAG should complete immediately with success status.

**Requirement 4.8 - Task State Persistence for Resume**
To support resume-from-failure, the system must persist task execution state including: completion status, output data or references, start/end timestamps, retry attempts made, and error details. State must be atomic and consistent even if system crashes mid-execution.

**Requirement 4.9 - Cascading Timeout Effects**
If upstream tasks timeout and are retrying with delays, downstream tasks may wait indefinitely. The system must implement a global DAG execution timeout that terminates the entire execution if the overall time budget is exceeded, regardless of individual task retry policies.

**Requirement 4.10 - Retry Storm Prevention**
If many tasks fail simultaneously and all retry with short delays, the system could create a resource spike. The system must support jittered retry delays to spread retry attempts over time and prevent thundering herd problems.

## 5. State Management & Observability

**Requirement 5.1 - Execution State Tracking**
The system must maintain real-time state for each task: PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, RETRYING, CANCELLED, SKIPPED, BLOCKED. State transitions must be thread-safe and observable through callbacks or events.

**Requirement 5.2 - Error Context Preservation**
For each failed task, the system must preserve the complete error context including exception stack traces, input parameters, attempt number, and timestamp. This context must be accessible for debugging and included in DAG-level failure reports.

**Requirement 5.3 - Progress Monitoring**
The system must provide real-time progress metrics including: total tasks, completed tasks, failed tasks, running tasks, and blocked tasks. Percentage completion should account for weighted task importance if configured.

## 6. Configuration & Extensibility

**Requirement 6.1 - Task-Specific Error Handlers**
Each task must support optional custom error handlers that can examine failures and decide whether to retry, skip, or fail. Handlers can modify retry parameters dynamically based on error details.

**Requirement 6.2 - Global Error Hooks**
The system must support global error listeners that are notified of all task failures, allowing centralized logging, alerting, or metrics collection without modifying individual tasks.

**Requirement 6.3 - Idempotency Guarantees**
For resume and retry scenarios, tasks must be designed to be idempotent. The system should provide utilities to help ensure idempotency such as execution ID tracking and duplicate detection, though ultimately task implementation is responsible.

## 7. Thread Safety & Concurrency

**Requirement 7.1 - Thread Pool Management**
The system must use a bounded thread pool to prevent resource exhaustion. When the pool is saturated, additional ready tasks must queue rather than creating unbounded threads.

**Requirement 7.2 - Deadlock Prevention**
Task execution must not hold locks while waiting for dependencies. The dependency resolution and task scheduling mechanism must be lock-free or use fine-grained locking to prevent deadlocks.

**Requirement 7.3 - Memory Safety**
Task results stored for downstream consumption must be managed carefully to prevent memory leaks. Consider using weak references, explicit cleanup after consumption, or streaming results for large data.
