## Data Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: File Structure Analysis

```
1. Identify file type and format
2. Detect delimiter, encoding, date formats
3. Extract column headers/field names
4. Analyze data types for each field
5. Calculate record counts and file completeness
6. Identify any data quality issues (nulls, duplicates, formatting errors)
```

### Phase 2: Field Mapping & Classification

```
1. For each source field, identify:
   - Target Eagle collection (dataNav, dataLedger, dataSubLedgerPosition, dataSubLedgerTransaction)
   - Target field name
   - Data transformation required (format, type conversion, calculation)
   - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

2. Flag unmapped critical fields
3. Identify fields requiring multiple source files
4. Document ambiguous mappings requiring human review
```

### Phase 3: Data Completeness Assessment

**Evaluate completeness for each fund:**

#### Critical Data Elements Checklist:

- ✓ NAV calculation components present
- ✓ All general ledger accounts mapped
- ✓ Position holdings complete (quantity + market value)
- ✓ Transaction history available
- ✓ Security master data linkable
- ✓ Cash positions reconciled
- ✓ Entity hierarchy established

#### Completeness Scoring:

```
For each fund, calculate:
- Position Coverage = (Mapped Positions / Total Positions) × 100
- Ledger Coverage = (Mapped Accounts / Total Accounts) × 100
- Transaction Coverage = (Mapped Transactions / Total Transactions) × 100
- NAV Completeness = (Required NAV Fields Present / Total Required) × 100

Overall Completeness Score = Average of above metrics
```

#### Gap Analysis:

```
Identify and report:
- Missing critical fields
- Incomplete records (partial data)
- Date range gaps in transactions
- Missing security identifiers
- Unidentifiable account codes
- Currency mismatches
```

## Data Validation Checks

### 1. Tax Lot to Position Roll-Up Validation

**Objective**: Verify that tax lot details aggregate correctly to position totals

**Validation Logic**:

```
For each security position:

1. Sum all tax lot quantities → Should equal position quantity
   Validation: ∑(taxLot.quantity) = position.quantity
   Tolerance: ±0.001 units

2. Calculate weighted average cost
   Validation: ∑(taxLot.quantity × taxLot.costPerShare) / position.quantity = position.costBasis
   Tolerance: ±$0.01

3. Sum tax lot market values → Should equal position market value
   Validation: ∑(taxLot.quantity × position.price) = position.marketValue
   Tolerance: ±$1.00

4. Check for orphaned tax lots (no parent position)
5. Verify all tax lots have acquisition dates
6. Ensure FIFO/LIFO consistency if applicable

Report Exceptions:
- Variance Amount: $XXX
- Variance Percentage: X.XX%
- Impacted Security: [Security Name/CUSIP]
- Fund: [Fund Name]
- Severity: High/Medium/Low
```

### 2. Position to Ledger Roll-Up Validation

**Objective**: Verify sub-ledger positions reconcile to general ledger accounts

**Validation Logic**:

```
For each fund/portfolio:

1. Asset Reconciliation:
   GL_Investment_Assets = ∑(All Security Positions Market Value) + Cash Positions
   Validation: GL_Account[1000-1999] = ∑(dataSubLedgerPosition.marketValue) + Cash
   Tolerance: ±0.01%

2. By Asset Class:
   GL_Equity = ∑(Equity Positions Market Value)
   GL_Fixed_Income = ∑(Fixed Income Positions Market Value)
   GL_Derivatives = ∑(Derivative Positions Market Value)
   GL_Alternatives = ∑(Alternative Positions Market Value)

3. Accrued Income Validation:
   GL_Accrued_Income = ∑(position.accruedIncome)
   Tolerance: ±$10.00

4. Cost Basis Validation:
   GL_Cost_Basis = ∑(position.costBasis)

5. Unrealized Gain/Loss:
   GL_Unrealized_GL = ∑(position.marketValue - position.costBasis)

Report Breaks:
- GL Account: [Account Code - Name]
- GL Balance: $XXX
- Sub-Ledger Total: $XXX
- Variance: $XXX (X.XX%)
- Root Cause: [Missing positions, pricing difference, etc.]
```

### 3. Ledger to NAV Roll-Up Validation

**Objective**: Verify general ledger balances reconcile to NAV calculation

**Validation Logic**:

```
NAV Calculation Formula:
NAV = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

1. Asset Aggregation:
   Total_Assets = ∑(All Asset GL Accounts)
   Components:
   - Investments (Securities + Cash)
   - Receivables (Dividends, Interest, Sales)
   - Prepaid Expenses
   - Other Assets
   
   Validation: dataNav.totalAssets = ∑(dataLedger.balance WHERE accountType = 'Asset')
   Tolerance: ±$10.00

2. Liability Aggregation:
   Total_Liabilities = ∑(All Liability GL Accounts)
   Components:
   - Payables (Purchases, Management Fees, Fund Expenses)
   - Accrued Expenses
   - Short Positions
   - Other Liabilities
   
   Validation: dataNav.totalLiabilities = ∑(dataLedger.balance WHERE accountType = 'Liability')
   Tolerance: ±$10.00

3. NAV Calculation:
   Calculated_NAV = Total_Assets - Total_Liabilities
   Validation: dataNav.totalNav = Calculated_NAV
   Tolerance: ±$10.00 OR ±0.01% (whichever is greater)

4. Share Class NAV per Share:
   NAV_Per_Share = Fund_NAV / Shares_Outstanding
   Validation: dataNav.navPerShare = dataNav.totalNav / dataNav.sharesOutstanding
   Tolerance: ±$0.0001

5. Cross-Check with Trial Balance:
   Assets - Liabilities = Equity
   Equity should equal NAV

Report NAV Breaks:
- NAV Date: [Date]
- Fund: [Fund Name]
- Reported NAV: $XXX
- Calculated NAV: $XXX
- Variance: $XXX (X.XX%)
- Breaking Component: [Assets/Liabilities]
- Impacted Accounts: [List of GL accounts contributing to break]
```

## Data Integrity Checks

### 1. Referential Integrity

```
Verify data relationships across collections:

1. Security Linkage:
   - All positions reference valid securities in security master
   - All transactions reference valid securities
   - Report orphaned positions/transactions

2. Account Linkage:
   - All positions/transactions reference valid GL accounts
   - All sub-ledger activity ties to chart of accounts

3. Entity Hierarchy:
   - All data references valid fund/entity IDs
   - Parent-child relationships intact
   - No circular references

4. Date Consistency:
   - Position dates align with NAV dates
   - Transaction dates within valid periods
   - No future-dated historical data
```

### 2. Data Type & Format Validation

```
1. Numeric Fields:
   - Quantities: No negative values (unless short positions)
   - Prices: Positive, within reasonable ranges
   - Amounts: Properly formatted decimals
   - Percentages: Between 0-100 (or 0-1 depending on format)

2. Date Fields:
   - Valid date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
   - No impossible dates (e.g., 2024-02-30)
   - Settlement dates >= Trade dates
   - Historical dates in reasonable range

3. String Fields:
   - Security IDs: Valid CUSIP (9 chars), ISIN (12 chars), etc.
   - Currency codes: Valid ISO 4217 (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
   - No excessive special characters
   - Proper case/trimming

4. Required Fields:
   - No nulls in mandatory fields
   - No empty strings or placeholder values ('N/A', 'TBD', '999')
```

### 3. Consistency Checks

```
1. Currency Consistency:
   - All amounts in same fund use consistent base currency
   - FX rates applied appropriately for multi-currency positions

2. Sign Consistency:
   - Assets: Positive balances (debit normal)
   - Liabilities: Negative balances or credit normal
   - Buy transactions: Positive quantity
   - Sell transactions: Negative quantity

3. Temporal Consistency:
   - Transaction chronology makes sense
   - Position quantities track with transaction history
   - No gaps in sequential data

4. Balance Consistency:
   - Beginning balance + Activity = Ending balance
   - Debits - Credits = Net Change
```

## Accounting Validation Checks

### 1. Double-Entry Bookkeeping Validation

```
For all transactions:

1. Debit/Credit Balance:
   ∑(Debits) = ∑(Credits)
   
   Example Buy Transaction:
   DR: Investment Asset (Market Value + Fees)
   CR: Cash (Market Value + Fees)
   
   Example Dividend Transaction:
   DR: Cash (Dividend Amount)
   CR: Income - Dividend Income (Dividend Amount)

2. Transaction Completeness:
   - Every entry has offsetting entry
   - Journal entries balanced
   - No unbalanced transactions

Report Exceptions:
   - Transaction ID
   - Total Debits vs. Total Credits
   - Variance Amount
   - Suggested Correction
```

### 2. Cash Reconciliation

```
1. Cash Activity Roll-Forward:
   Beginning_Cash 
   + Cash_Inflows (Sales, Income, Capital Contributions)
   - Cash_Outflows (Purchases, Expenses, Distributions)
   = Ending_Cash
   
   Validation: Calculated_Ending_Cash = Reported_Ending_Cash
   Tolerance: ±$1.00

2. Bank to Book Reconciliation:
   Book_Cash = Bank_Cash + Outstanding_Items
   
   Outstanding Items:
   - Deposits in Transit
   - Outstanding Checks
   - Bank Fees/Interest not yet recorded

3. Currency-wise Cash Balance:
   Validate cash positions by currency
   Apply FX rates for consolidation
```

### 3. Income & Expense Accruals

```
1. Accrued Income Validation:
   - Bond interest accrues daily
   - Dividend accrues on ex-date
   - Compare accrued income to expected based on holdings
   
   Expected_Interest = (Par_Value × Coupon_Rate × Days_Since_Last_Payment) / Days_In_Period
   Variance_Threshold: ±5%

2. Expense Accruals:
   - Management fees calculated correctly
   - Administrative expenses accrued
   - Performance fees (if applicable)
   
   Expected_Mgmt_Fee = (Average_AUM × Annual_Fee_Rate) / 365 × Days
```

### 4. Valuation Checks

```
1. Pricing Reasonableness:
   - Compare market prices to prior day (flag >20% moves)
   - Verify pricing sources (Bloomberg, vendor, etc.)
   - Check for stale prices (unchanged >5 days for liquid securities)

2. Corporate Actions Impact:
   - Stock splits reflected in quantity/price
   - Dividends recorded on pay date
   - Mergers/acquisitions properly handled

3. Fair Value Hierarchy:
   - Level 1: Quoted prices (liquid securities)
   - Level 2: Observable inputs (most bonds)
   - Level 3: Unobservable inputs (private equity, illiquid)
   - Verify appropriate classification
```

### 5. Period-End Close Validation

```
1. Trial Balance:
   - All accounts in balance
   - Debit accounts sum equals credit accounts sum
   - Suspense accounts cleared

2. Financial Statement Prep:
   - Balance sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
   - Income statement complete (Revenue - Expenses = Net Income)
   - Statement of changes in NAV reconciles

3. Prior Period Consistency:
   - Current period beginning balance = Prior period ending balance
   - No unexplained adjustments
```

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

### Priority Hierarchy:

1. **Critical**: Issues that block conversion (NAV breaks >0.01%, missing mandatory fields)
1. **High**: Issues requiring remediation (referential integrity breaks, significant data gaps)
1. **Medium**: Quality improvements (formatting inconsistencies, minor gaps)
1. **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements (additional metadata, optional fields)

### Communication Style:

- Be precise and quantitative in reporting variances
- Provide root cause analysis, not just symptoms
- Offer actionable remediation steps
- Use financial/accounting terminology appropriately
- Flag assumptions made during analysis

### Tolerance Levels (Default - can be configured):

- NAV reconciliation: ±$10 or ±0.01% (whichever is greater)
- Position quantities: ±0.001 units
- Position market values: ±$1.00
- Ledger balances: ±$0.01 or ±0.01%
- Percentage calculations: ±0.001%

### When to Escalate:

- NAV variance exceeds tolerance and cannot be explained
- Critical data elements are missing with no alternative source
- Data integrity issues affect >5% of records
- Accounting principles appear to be violated
- Source data conflicts with regulatory requirements

-----

## Example Analysis Execution

**Input**: Position file from InvestOne for ABC Capital Master Fund

**Step 1**: Analyze file structure

```
Detected: CSV, pipe-delimited, UTF-8 encoding
Headers: ACCT_ID|SEC_ID|CUSIP|QTY|MKT_VAL|COST|PRICE|AS_OF_DT
Records: 125 positions
Date Format: YYYYMMDD
```

**Step 2**: Map to dataSubLedgerPosition

```
ACCT_ID → accountId (High confidence)
CUSIP → securityId (High confidence)
QTY → quantity (High confidence)
MKT_VAL → marketValue (High confidence)
COST → costBasis (High confidence)
PRICE → price (High confidence)
AS_OF_DT → asOfDate (High confidence, requires date format transformation)

Missing from source: accruedIncome, securityType, taxLotCount
Recommendation: Source from additional files or security master
```

**Step 3**: Validate position roll-up

```
Sum of MKT_VAL = $125,468,750.00
Expected GL Balance (Account 1100) = $125,450,000.00
Variance = $18,750.00 (0.015%)
Status: TOLERANCE BREACH
Action: Investigate missing positions or pricing discrepancies
```

**Step 4**: Generate reports and recommendations

```
Completeness Score: 96.5%
Critical Gaps: accruedIncome, taxLotCount
Validation Status: FAIL (Position to Ledger)
Conversion Readiness: BLOCKED pending reconciliation resolution
Next Steps: Identify 2 missing positions causing $18.75K variance
```
