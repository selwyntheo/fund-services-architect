# Generic Kafka Publisher Component

## Story Title

As a data integration engineer, I want a generic Kafka publisher component that can format and publish messages using GitLab-stored schemas, so that I can easily integrate different data sources with Kafka topics without custom development.

## Story Description

Create a reusable component that publishes messages to Kafka topics using schema definitions stored in GitLab repositories. The component should accept pre-formatted data from upstream processing steps and handle the final message formatting and publication based on configurable schema mappings.

## Business Value

- Reduces development time for new Kafka integrations
- Ensures consistent message formatting across different data sources
- Centralizes schema management through GitLab
- Provides flexible configuration without code changes
- Enables non-technical users to configure Kafka publishing through UI

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** data integration engineer  
**I want** a generic component that can publish formatted messages to configurable Kafka topics using GitLab-stored schemas  
**So that** I can quickly set up new data pipelines without writing custom Kafka publishing code

### Secondary User Stories

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** full UI-based configuration of Kafka parameters  
**So that** I can modify publishing behavior without code deployments

**As a** data architect  
**I want** schema definitions stored in GitLab  
**So that** I can version control and manage schemas centrally

## Acceptance Criteria

### Schema Management

- [ ] Component retrieves schema definitions from specified GitLab repository
- [ ] Supports multiple schema formats (JSON Schema, Avro, Protobuf)
- [ ] Caches schemas locally with configurable TTL
- [ ] Handles schema versioning and retrieval of specific versions
- [ ] Provides schema validation before message publishing

### Message Processing

- [ ] Accepts input data from previous pipeline step
- [ ] Formats messages according to retrieved schema definition
- [ ] Applies field mappings as configured in the UI
- [ ] Validates formatted messages against schema before publishing
- [ ] Handles data type conversions as specified in schema

### Kafka Publishing

- [ ] Publishes formatted messages to specified Kafka topic
- [ ] Supports configurable Kafka producer properties
- [ ] Implements configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Provides dead letter queue functionality for failed messages
- [ ] Supports both synchronous and asynchronous publishing modes

### UI Configuration

- [ ] Topic selection dropdown populated from Kafka cluster
- [ ] Schema repository and path configuration fields
- [ ] Field mapping interface between input data and schema fields
- [ ] Kafka producer parameter configuration (batch size, compression, etc.)
- [ ] Retry policy configuration (max retries, backoff strategy)
- [ ] Enable/disable dead letter queue with topic configuration

### Error Handling & Monitoring

- [ ] Logs detailed error information for troubleshooting
- [ ] Emits metrics for successful/failed publications
- [ ] Provides health check endpoint
- [ ] Handles network failures gracefully with appropriate retries
- [ ] Validates configuration parameters on component initialization

### Security & Authentication

- [ ] Supports GitLab authentication (token-based)
- [ ] Integrates with Kafka security protocols (SASL, SSL)
- [ ] Masks sensitive configuration values in logs
- [ ] Supports environment-specific credential management

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

- [ ] Handles minimum 1000 messages/second throughput
- [ ] Schema caching reduces GitLab API calls
- [ ] Configurable batching for improved performance
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under sustained load

### Dependencies

- [ ] Kafka Client Library (latest stable version)
- [ ] GitLab API client
- [ ] Schema validation library (appropriate for supported formats)
- [ ] JSON/XML processing libraries
- [ ] Configuration management framework

### Configuration Schema

```yaml
kafka_publisher:
  kafka:
    bootstrap_servers: "localhost:9092"
    topic: "target-topic-name"
    producer_config:
      batch_size: 16384
      compression_type: "gzip"
      retries: 3
  schema:
    gitlab_url: "https://gitlab.company.com"
    repository: "data-schemas/kafka-schemas"
    schema_path: "schemas/user-events/v1.0/schema.json"
    auth_token: "${GITLAB_TOKEN}"
    cache_ttl: 3600
  mapping:
    field_mappings:
      - source: "user_id"
        target: "userId"
        type: "string"
      - source: "timestamp"
        target: "eventTime"
        type: "datetime"
  error_handling:
    max_retries: 3
    backoff_strategy: "exponential"
    dead_letter_topic: "failed-messages"
    enable_dlq: true
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Component passes all unit tests (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with real Kafka cluster pass
- [ ] UI configuration interface is functional and user-friendly
- [ ] Documentation includes configuration examples and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet specified requirements
- [ ] Security review completed and approved
- [ ] Component deployed to staging environment and tested
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Component should handle increased load through horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for message publishing under normal conditions
- **Maintainability**: Code follows established coding standards and patterns
- **Usability**: UI configuration can be completed by non-developers
- **Security**: All credentials encrypted at rest and in transit

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- GitLab repository access with appropriate permissions
- Kafka cluster is accessible and properly configured
- Schema formats are standardized across the organization
- Upstream data processing step provides consistent data format
- UI framework supports dynamic form generation

## Risks & Mitigations

|Risk                                      |Impact|Mitigation                                        |
|------------------------------------------|------|--------------------------------------------------|
|GitLab API rate limiting                  |High  |Implement schema caching with reasonable TTL      |
|Kafka cluster unavailability              |High  |Implement circuit breaker and dead letter queue   |
|Schema evolution breaking compatibility   |Medium|Version schema properly and validate compatibility|
|Performance degradation with large schemas|Medium|Optimize schema parsing and implement caching     |

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Mock GitLab API and Kafka producer for isolated testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real GitLab repository and test Kafka cluster
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with various message sizes and rates
- **UI Tests**: Automated testing of configuration interface
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete pipeline testing from data input to Kafka publication
