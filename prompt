## EXTRACTION RULES:

### 1. DATE FORMATTING:

- ALL dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- If month/day are unclear, use best judgment based on context
- If year is missing, assume current year
- Mark uncertain dates in processing_notes

### 2. AMOUNT EXTRACTION:

- Remove ALL currency symbols and commas
- Use decimal points for cents (e.g., 1250.50 not 1,250.50)
- If amount appears in parentheses (), treat as negative
- Cross-validate totals against line item sums
- Flag discrepancies in data_quality_issues

### 3. TEXT NORMALIZATION:

- Trim whitespace from all text fields
- Convert to proper case for names and addresses
- Preserve original formatting for IDs and codes
- Remove special characters except hyphens and underscores in codes

### 4. FUND ACCOUNTING SPECIFICS:

- Look for fund codes in multiple locations: header, line items, GL codes
- Extract department/program codes from account strings
- Identify grant numbers from references or descriptions
- Map cost centers from various naming conventions

### 5. VENDOR VARIATIONS HANDLING:

For common vendor variations, standardize as follows:

- “Microsoft Corp” / “Microsoft Corporation” / “MSFT” → “Microsoft Corporation”
- “Amazon Web Services” / “AWS” / “Amazon WS” → “Amazon Web Services”
- Apply similar logic for other vendors

### 6. MISSING DATA PROTOCOL:

- Use “null” for missing required fields
- Estimate missing data ONLY if high confidence (>90%)
- Document estimation method in processing_notes
- Set manual_review_required: true for critical missing data

## FUND ACCOUNTING CONTEXT:

You are processing invoices for fund accounting where:

- Each transaction must be properly coded to funds/grants
- Budget compliance is critical
- Audit trails must be complete
- Multi-year grants may have specific coding requirements
- Board approval may be required for large amounts

## PROCESSING WORKFLOW:

1. **Initial Scan**: Identify document type and basic structure
1. **Header Extraction**: Get invoice number, date, vendor, totals
1. **Line Item Processing**: Extract each line with full coding
1. **Cross-Validation**: Verify totals, check for inconsistencies
1. **Fund Coding**: Map to appropriate accounting codes
1. **Quality Check**: Assess data completeness and accuracy
1. **Flag Generation**: Identify items requiring attention

## CONFIDENCE SCORING:

Calculate confidence_score based on:

- Data completeness (25%)
- Total validation accuracy (25%)
- Text clarity/OCR quality (25%)
- Standard format recognition (25%)

## COMMON FUND ACCOUNTING PATTERNS:

### Account Code Formats:

- XXX-XXX-XXXX (Fund-Dept-Object)
- XXXX.XXXX.XXXX (Fund.Program.Activity)
- XX-XXXX-XXX-XXXX (Year-Fund-Dept-Object)

### Grant References:

- “Grant #12345”
- “Federal Award: CFDA 12.345”
- “Contract No: ABC-2024-001”

### Fund Indicators:

- “General Fund”, “Special Revenue”, “Capital Projects”
- “Restricted”, “Unrestricted”, “Designated”
- “Federal”, “State”, “Local”, “Private”

## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Return ONLY the JSON object with extracted data
1. Ensure ALL required fields are present (use null if no data)
1. Double-check all numerical values for accuracy
1. Include detailed processing_notes for any assumptions made
1. Set appropriate flags for items requiring manual review

Now process the provided invoice document and return the extraction results in the exact JSON format specified above.

```
## Enhanced Validation Prompt (Use as Follow-up)
```

Please validate the extracted invoice data against these fund accounting business rules:

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST:

### Financial Validation:

1. ✓ Invoice total equals sum of line items + taxes + fees
1. ✓ Tax calculations are mathematically correct
1. ✓ No negative amounts unless properly marked as credits
1. ✓ Currency consistency throughout document

### Fund Accounting Validation:

1. ✓ All line items have valid fund codes
1. ✓ Department codes follow organization standards
1. ✓ Grant numbers match expected formats
1. ✓ Cost centers are properly assigned

### Data Quality Validation:

1. ✓ All dates are reasonable (not future dates unless expected)
1. ✓ Vendor information is complete and properly formatted
1. ✓ PO numbers follow expected patterns
1. ✓ Required approvals are documented

### Compliance Validation:

1. ✓ Large amounts (>$10,000) flagged for board approval
1. ✓ New vendors flagged for verification
1. ✓ Budget code completeness verified
1. ✓ Missing PO numbers flagged if required

Return any validation errors found and suggest corrections while maintaining the exact JSON structure.

```
## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. **Field Mapping Templates**
```

VENDOR NAME EXTRACTION PATTERNS:

- Look for: “From:”, “Vendor:”, “Bill From:”, “Supplier:”, “Company Name”
- Location: Usually top-left or header section
- Validation: Cross-check with address and contact info

INVOICE NUMBER PATTERNS:

- Look for: “Invoice #”, “Invoice No.”, “Inv #”, “Document Number”
- Format: Usually alphanumeric, may include prefixes/suffixes
- Location: Header area, often top-right

AMOUNT EXTRACTION HIERARCHY:

1. “Total Amount Due” or “Amount Due”
1. “Invoice Total” or “Total”
1. “Balance Due”
1. Last line with currency symbol

```
### 2. **Error Prevention Strategies**
```

COMMON EXTRACTION ERRORS TO AVOID:

1. Confusing invoice date with due date
1. Missing negative amounts in credit memos
1. Extracting tax-inclusive vs tax-exclusive amounts
1. Misreading similar characters (0/O, 1/I, 5/S)
1. Truncating long vendor names or addresses

VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. Cross-check extracted total against visible calculations
1. Verify date formats make logical sense
1. Ensure vendor name matches address context
1. Validate account codes against common patterns

```
### 3. **Multi-Language Support**
```

INTERNATIONAL INVOICE TERMS:

- Spanish: “Factura”, “Total”, “Fecha”, “Proveedor”
- French: “Facture”, “Montant”, “Date”, “Fournisseur”
- German: “Rechnung”, “Betrag”, “Datum”, “Lieferant”

Always include original language terms in processing_notes when applicable.

```
## Implementation Example

### Python Integration Code:
```python
import json
from typing import Dict, Any
import anthropic

class FundAccountingInvoiceExtractor:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=api_key)
        self.extraction_prompt = self._load_master_prompt()
        self.validation_prompt = self._load_validation_prompt()
    
    async def extract_invoice(self, invoice_content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract invoice data with validation"""
        
        # Primary extraction
        extraction_response = await self.client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            max_tokens=4000,
            temperature=0.1,  # Low temperature for consistency
            messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"{self.extraction_prompt}\n\nINVOICE TO PROCESS:\n{invoice_content}"
            }]
        )
        
        # Parse JSON response
        extracted_data = json.loads(extraction_response.content[0].text)
        
        # Validation pass
        validation_response = await self.client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            max_tokens=2000,
            temperature=0.1,
            messages=[{
                "role": "user", 
                "content": f"{self.validation_prompt}\n\nEXTRACTED DATA:\n{json.dumps(extracted_data, indent=2)}"
            }]
        )
        
        # Apply any corrections suggested by validation
        if "corrections" in validation_response.content[0].text.lower():
            extracted_data = self._apply_corrections(extracted_data, validation_response)
        
        return extracted_data
    
    def _apply_corrections(self, data: Dict, validation_response: Any) -> Dict:
        """Apply validation corrections"""
        # Implementation depends on validation response format
        return data
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Test Invoice Scenarios:

1. **Standard Corporate Invoice** - Clean format, all fields present
1. **Utility Bill** - Different layout, recurring charges
1. **Professional Services** - Time-based billing, multiple projects
1. **International Invoice** - Different currency, tax systems
1. **Credit Memo** - Negative amounts, reference to original invoice
1. **Multi-Page Invoice** - Line items spanning pages
1. **Handwritten Elements** - Mixed digital/manual entries
1. **Poor Quality Scan** - Test OCR accuracy limits

### Success Metrics:

- **Field Extraction Accuracy**: >95% for critical fields
- **Amount Accuracy**: 100% for financial totals
- **Consistency Score**: Same vendor invoices should extract identically
- **Processing Time**: <30 seconds per invoice
